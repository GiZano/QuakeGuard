# File: esp32_config.env
# Description: Environment variables injected into the firmware during build.
# Target Environment: Local Network / HTTP (Non-Secure)
# ==============================================================================

# --- Network Connectivity (WiFi) ---
# SSID and Password for the local access point.
WIFI_SSID="YOUR_DEV_SSID"
WIFI_PASS="YOUR_DEV_PASSWORD"

# --- Backend Connection (HTTP) ---
# Target Host IP Address.
# NOTE: Do not use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" as these refer to the ESP32 itself.
# Use the IPv4 address of the workstation running the backend service.
# Example: 192.168.1.50
SERVER_HOST="192.168.1.50"

# Target Port.
# Standard port for local development (e.g., Uvicorn/FastAPI default).
SERVER_PORT=8000

# API Endpoint Path.
SERVER_PATH="/misurations/"

# --- Device Identity ---
# The unique integer ID corresponding to the 'misurators' table in the database.
# Ensure this ID is registered in the local backend database before operation.
SENSOR_ID=101

# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY & CRYPTOGRAPHY NOTE
# ==============================================================================
# Cryptographic keys (Private/Public ECDSA pairs) are NOT configured in this file.
# Keys are automatically generated by the firmware upon first initialization
# and stored securely in the device's NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) partition.
#
# Check the Serial Monitor output on boot to retrieve the Public Key.
