# QuakeGuard - Diagnostic & Test Modules

## Overview
This directory contains isolated firmware utilities designed for hardware verification and algorithm tuning of the **QuakeGuard** seismic node. These scripts operate independently of the main production firmware and are intended to troubleshoot physical connection issues or calibrate the detection logic without network dependencies.

## Target Hardware
* **MCU:** ESP32-C3 SuperMini
* **Sensor:** ADXL345 (I2C)
* **Pin Configuration:** SDA = GPIO 7, SCL = GPIO 8

## 1. Hardware I2C Scanner
**Filename:** `i2c_scanner.cpp`

### Description
A low-level utility designed to verify the physical integrity of the I2C bus and identifying connected peripherals. It is configured specifically for the non-standard pinout of the ESP32-C3 SuperMini.

### Key Configuration
* **Bus Speed:** 10 kHz (Conservative speed to rule out signal impedance issues).
* **Timeout:** High tolerance for unstable connections.

### Usage
Upload this script if the main firmware reports "Sensor Not Found".
* **Expected Output (Success):**
  ```text
  I2C device found at address 0x53  !
  ```
* **Output (Failure):**
  ```text
  No I2C devices found
  ```
